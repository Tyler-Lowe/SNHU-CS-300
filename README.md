## Problem Statement
In the CS 300 course projects, the central problem was creating a program to assist academic advisors by managing course data efficiently. The challenge was to implement a solution that could handle course information sorting and retrieval with specific considerations for runtime and memory optimization.

## Approach to the Problem
My approach was methodical, starting with an in-depth analysis of various data structures to understand their runtime behavior and memory usage. Recognizing the importance of data structures, I selected a binary search tree for its efficiency in sorted data operations, which was critical for the task at hand.

## Overcoming Roadblocks
Encountering roadblocks, particularly with binary search tree implementation and file I/O, was an enlightening part of the process. I utilized systematic debugging, peer collaboration, and resourceful research to resolve these issues, which reinforced my problem-solving skills.

## Impact on Software Design Approach
Working on this project has broadened my perspective on software design. It has ingrained in me the importance of foresight in architectural decisions, making me more adept at foreseeing potential challenges and designing software that is both scalable and robust.

## Evolution of Programming Practices
This project has significantly refined my coding practices. I have become more diligent in writing code that is not only functional but also maintainable, readable, and adaptableâ€”qualities that I now understand are as crucial as functionality.
